EV3 hardware control logic
The codebase here is all the logic scripts so far!

both xtest and ytest were the first & best verions of the code written to first get the lovely motors turning.
the test_ChessBoard scripts are written with an understanding that there are 8 squares an axis to visit and they are all great.
the demo script was used for the Week 4 demo (Demo 1)
